## Basic Questions

### 1. What is Jetpack Compose?
**Answer:**
Jetpack Compose is a modern toolkit for building native Android UI. It simplifies and accelerates UI development on Android with less code, powerful tools, and intuitive Kotlin APIs.

### 2. What are Composable functions?
**Answer:**
Composable functions are the fundamental building blocks of a Jetpack Compose UI. These functions allow you to define your UI in a declarative way, meaning you describe how your UI should look based on the current state.

```kotlin
@Composable
fun Greeting(name: String) {
    Text(text = "Hello, $name!")
}
```

### 3. How do you make a Composable function?
**Answer:**
To make a Composable function, use the `@Composable` annotation. Composable functions can call other composable functions.

```kotlin
@Composable
fun MyComposable() {
    Text(text = "Hello World!")
}
```

### 4. What is the `remember` function in Jetpack Compose?
**Answer:**
The `remember` function is used to store a single object in memory. The stored object survives recompositions and is forgotten when the composition that called `remember` is removed.

```kotlin
@Composable
fun Counter() {
    var count by remember { mutableStateOf(0) }
    Button(onClick = { count++ }) {
        Text("Clicked $count times")
    }
}
```

## State Management

### 5. What is state hoisting in Jetpack Compose?
**Answer:**
State hoisting is a pattern in Jetpack Compose where you move the state of a composable function up to its caller. This is done to make the composable stateless and reusable.

```kotlin
@Composable
fun Counter(count: Int, onIncrement: () -> Unit) {
    Button(onClick = onIncrement) {
        Text("Clicked $count times")
    }
}

@Composable
fun Parent() {
    var count by remember { mutableStateOf(0) }
    Counter(count = count, onIncrement = { count++ })
}
```

### 6. Explain the difference between `mutableStateOf` and `LiveData`.
**Answer:**
`mutableStateOf` is used in Jetpack Compose to hold state that can be read and modified within a composable function. `LiveData` is a lifecycle-aware observable used in traditional Android development, often in ViewModels, to hold and observe data changes.

```kotlin
// mutableStateOf example
var count by remember { mutableStateOf(0) }

// LiveData example
val liveData: LiveData<Int> = MutableLiveData()
```

## Layouts and Modifiers

### 7. What are `Column` and `Row` in Jetpack Compose?
**Answer:**
`Column` and `Row` are composables that lay out their children in a vertical and horizontal sequence respectively.

```kotlin
@Composable
fun MyLayout() {
    Column {
        Text("Item 1")
        Text("Item 2")
    }
    
    Row {
        Text("Item 1")
        Text("Item 2")
    }
}
```

### 8. How do you use `Modifier` in Jetpack Compose?
**Answer:**
`Modifier` is a collection of functions that can be applied to composables to change their appearance, layout, or behavior. You can chain multiple modifiers to a composable.

```kotlin
@Composable
fun MyBox() {
    Box(
        modifier = Modifier
            .background(Color.Red)
            .size(100.dp)
            .padding(16.dp)
    ) {
        Text("Hello")
    }
}
```

## Advanced Topics

### 9. Explain how to handle navigation in Jetpack Compose.
**Answer:**
Jetpack Compose provides a `NavController` to handle navigation between composables. Define a `NavHost` and use `composable` function to declare each destination.

```kotlin
@Composable
fun MyAppNavHost(navController: NavController) {
    NavHost(navController, startDestination = "home") {
        composable("home") { HomeScreen(navController) }
        composable("details") { DetailsScreen() }
    }
}

@Composable
fun HomeScreen(navController: NavController) {
    Button(onClick = { navController.navigate("details") }) {
        Text("Go to Details")
    }
}
```

### 10. How do you create a theme in Jetpack Compose?
**Answer:**
Themes in Jetpack Compose are created using `MaterialTheme`. Define colors, typography, and shapes in the `MaterialTheme` block.

```kotlin
private val DarkColorPalette = darkColors(
    primary = Color.Blue,
    primaryVariant = Color.DarkBlue,
    secondary = Color.Cyan
)

@Composable
fun MyAppTheme(content: @Composable () -> Unit) {
    MaterialTheme(
        colors = DarkColorPalette,
        typography = Typography,
        shapes = Shapes,
        content = content
    )
}
```

## Animation

### 11. How do you create animations in Jetpack Compose?
**Answer:**
Use `animate*AsState` functions for simple animations and `Transition` for complex animations.

```kotlin
@Composable
fun AnimateColor() {
    var isRed by remember { mutableStateOf(true) }
    val color by animateColorAsState(if (isRed) Color.Red else Color.Blue)

    Box(
        Modifier
            .size(100.dp)
            .background(color)
            .clickable { isRed = !isRed }
    )
}
```

## Practical Examples

### 12. How do you display a list using `LazyColumn`?
**Answer:**
Use `LazyColumn` for displaying a scrollable list of items. Each item is created by a composable function.

```kotlin
@Composable
fun MyList(items: List<String>) {
    LazyColumn {
        items(items) { item ->
            Text(text = item)
        }
    }
}
```

### 13. How do you handle user input in Jetpack Compose?
**Answer:**
Use `TextField` composable for text input and handle changes using state.

```kotlin
@Composable
fun MyTextField() {
    var text by remember { mutableStateOf("") }
    TextField(
        value = text,
        onValueChange = { text = it },
        label = { Text("Enter text") }
    )
}
```
